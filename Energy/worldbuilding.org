* Energy
** Basic Energy Rules
All energy requires the user to channel it to be, used. Most energies require both arms to be free for the elbow down.
*** Energy points (ep)
Some energies require (ep) to use (there are: Life, Kinetic, Time). Energy points is; stored, named, measured and, regained differently for each energy. The energies that don't use (ep) simply manipulate the already excising energy in the world.   
*** Energy Devices and Crystals
Energy is a form of power and it obeys the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics][first law of thermodynamics]] energy crystals are natural deposits of energy most of witch act as batteries as such they can be discharged and then recharged (only can be recharged by a user of the same energy as the crystal). These crystals can be used to power different devices that then can do thighs similar to use energy but at a much lower efficacy.    

** Energy Types
| Color  | Name      | Description                                                                                                           |

| Purple | Ethereal  | Allows the user to either create portals a short distance away or either retrieve or deposed an item into the Either. |
| Black  | Life/Dark | Gives the user the ability to both drain and restore life from a willing/broken living object.                        |
| Yellow | Kinetic   | Turns the users caloric energy into kinetic energy witch can be, directed towards any thing in sight (max:100m).      |
| White  | Fusing    | Grants the user the ability to combine and control the energy of willing/unconscious channeled energy users.          |

*** Life/Dark (Black)
 Life energy gives the user the ability to both drain and restore life from a willing/broken entity with life force. The draining of life force restores (ep) while the restoring to others and performing energy actions depletes (ep). For dark energy users the total depletion of (ep) is lethal having low (ep) has negative side effects on the wielder (chart below).

*** Mind (Pink)
Can see and manipulate for a (ep) cost the Mind-web. the Mind-web is both the web of ideas in ones mind as well as the web of ideas amongst individuals and groups. Energy points must be used to do any manipulations to find the (ep) cost multiply the group size by the manipulation size to get the total (ep) cost. Mind energy is gained by daring minds of one the user has killed this will permanently leave the user with this persons memories witch will lead to insanity of time as well as loss of ones selfie.

*** Time (Green)
Gives the user the ability to glide theme selves and any items on there person thru time for a cost of (ep), But either traveling too fast or to far can have severe side effects in the forum of uncontrollable displacement thru time. Whilst traveling thru time the user will NOT be move in position relative the nearest gravitational body of ant lest 3/10G . 

**** Level Table
For jumps larger than the max safe time refer the function blow.

| High Master  | Max safe travel 60m.  |
| Grand Master | Max safe travel 100m. |
***** Jump distance function
This is used to both find and, represent how to find the random variation in time energy time travel.
